# Tic-Tac-Toe
This project is a Python-based console Tic-Tac-Toe game where the player (X) competes against an AI (O). The AI selects random moves, while the program validates inputs, updates the board, and checks winning conditions across rows, columns, and diagonals. It demonstrates concepts like input handling, list operations, recursion, and game logic.
